## About Infinite (ERC721i) NFT Pre-Mint Contracts v0.1.4

Gas-efficient contracts for Pre-Minting 1,000,000,000 NFTs!

It's like handing out Candy!

Our goal is to Eliminate Minting Fees for all NFT projects by providing a new method of Pre-Minting an entire collection up-front for half the cost of minting a single, standard NFT.  Everything afterwards remains standard.

We have created Infinite (ERC721i) by utilizing and only slightly adapting the popular [Open Zeppelin ERC721 contracts](https://www.openzeppelin.com/contracts) in order to maintain the highest level of open standards. However, the approach we have taken is so simple, that it can be easily adapted to any ERC721 framework.

By eliminating the heavy-lifting of Minting, we can help to alleviate some of the network congestion caused when there is huge demand for a new token release. Miners are simply able to process more "transfers" than "mints" in a single block.

For more information on how Infinite (ERC721i) works under the hood, please visit our [blog](https://medium.com/charged-particles/infinite-erc721i-pre-minting-1-million-nfts-for-3-9a791a1f9a33).

**These contracts, while simple, have not been audited. Charged Particles, and its affiliates, are not liable for any outcome as a result of using Infinite (ERC721i).**

## ConsecutiveTransfer Event

We use the ConsecutiveTransfer event of [EIP-2309](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2309) during the Mint Phase.

Known marketplaces that support the EIP-2309 Standard:
- Opensea
- LooksRare



---
## Roadmap

- [ ] Implement Pre-Mint for ERC1155
- [ ] Add support for Upgradeable Contracts
- [ ] Add version using Solmate's ERC721 contracts
- [ ] Eliminate the Max-Supply and bring back the “allTokens” array.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/Charged-Particles/erc721i/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
